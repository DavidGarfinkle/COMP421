(a)
This script required four jobs, the first generating two Maps. Other than that, every job generated one Map and one Reduce.

The schema after the join looks lke:

airplanes::carrier_code:chararray,airplanes::carrier_name:chararray,airplanes::tail_number:chararray,delayedFlights::day:int,delayedFlights::flight_number:chararray,delayedFlights::tail_number:chararray,delayedFlights::origin_airport_id:int,delayedFlights::dest_airport_id:int,delayedFlights::delay:int,delayedFlights::distance:int

Pig script completed in 5 minutes, 34 seconds and 945 milliseconds (334945 ms)

(b)

In the first job, we generated two maps and four reduces
In the second, one map and one reduce
In the third and fourth, one map and four reduces

Pig script completed in 2 minutes, 25 seconds and 741 milliseconds (145741 ms)

The halving of query-time is in line with our expectations, given that we had nearly no parallelism in our first attempt. Our data is now being processed in parallel
